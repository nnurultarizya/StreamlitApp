# what is streamlit?
Streamlit turns data scripts into shareable web apps in minutes.
All in pure Python. No frontâ€‘end experience required.It helps us create web apps for data science and machine learning in a short time. 
It is compatible with major Python libraries such as scikit-learn, Keras, PyTorch, SymPy(latex), NumPy, pandas, Matplotlib etc.

# Prequest
- you have to install python which has pip, how to install pip can be seen [here](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/).
- run the installation on the file [requirements.txt](requirements.txt)
- ```commandline 
  pip install -r /path/to/requirements.txt
    ```
  
# How to run this code
- after you have installed pip, next is to run the program by running the following command:
- ```commandline
    streamlit run summary.py
    ```
- then you will be directed to the socket which is opened to show the frontend view
- if you want to share publicly, try reading [this documentation](https://towardsdatascience.com/deploy-a-public-streamlit-web-app-for-free-heres-how-bf56d46b2abe)
- if you want to change data(path) then change on 27th line.

# def fuction
- `st_wirete_accuracy()`. This function is created to call values from Accuracy, Recall, Precision and F-measure.
- `button_display()`. This function is to display the buttons on each page
- `logo_()`. shows where the logo and logo creation is in the center
- `confusion_matrix_plot(x,y)`. to display the confusion matrix on each model
- `smote()`. this function will take a little time to run as it is required in calling all three models.
- `grafik_actual_vs_predict()`.This function will call the predicted result which will be compared with the actual situation
